    <h1> ITMD 441 </h1>
    <h3> Hello! I'm Fatimah Syed</h3>
    <p>I am a third-year undergraduate student at Illinois Tech majoring in Information Technogloy and Management and minoring in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include swimming, badminton, baking, playing video games, and golden-hour photography! 
    <p>I am taking ITMD 442 this semester, and this course covers the fundamental concepts and techniques of full-stack web development, focusing on server-delivered front-end content such as server-rendered HTML or JSON and its integration with back-end architectures and data stores.</p>
    <p>I possess a decent understanding of web designing as I previously took three web development courses: ITMD 361, 362, and 441.</p>
